# Financial Time Series Analysis: Term Structure and Crypto Risk

This project applies financial time series techniques to model US Treasury yield curves and cryptocurrency prices. Developed as part of MATH 60210 (Winter 2022) at HEC MontrÃ©al, the notebook demonstrates real-time data acquisition, term structure modeling, and risk analysis.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Scope

- Analyze and visualize the US Treasury yield curve using FRB_H15 data
- Retrieve and model historical crypto prices (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash) using FRED
- Implement functions for data fetching with `pandas_datareader` and local caching
- Explore risk and return characteristics across asset classes using time series techniques

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- statsmodels
- pandas_datareader
- matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ Topics Covered

- Term structure modeling
- Risk and volatility estimation
- Data wrangling and missing value handling
- Cryptocurrency time series analysis
